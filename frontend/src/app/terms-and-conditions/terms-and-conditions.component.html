                            to improve the responsiveness of the sites for our users, we may use “cookies”, or similar
                            electronic tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique, random number as a
                            User Identification (User ID) to understand the user’s individual interests using the
                            Identified Computer. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for
                            example), we will have no way of knowing who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your
                            computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply (an
                            example of this is when you ask for our Personalised Horoscope). A cookie cannot read data
                            off your hard drive. Our advertisers may also assign their own cookies to your browser (if
                            you click on their ads), a process that we do not control.</p>

                            number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data — such as
                            the web pages you view.) Your IP address does not identify you personally. We use this
                            information to deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our site to the
                            interests of our users, to measure traffic within our site and let advertisers know the

                            governmental agency or authority to disclose, for the purpose of verification of identity,
                            or for the prevention, detection, investigation including cyber incidents, or for

                            that such disclosure is reasonably necessary for enforcing these Terms; for complying with
                            the applicable laws and regulations.</p>

                            process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy
                            Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>
                        <p><strong>INFORMATION SECURITY</strong><br>
                            we take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or
                            unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews
                            of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, including
                            appropriate encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access
                            to systems where we store personal data.</p>
                        <p>All information gathered on our Website is securely stored within our controlled database.
                            The database is stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is
                            password-protected and is strictly limited. However, as effective as our security measures
                            are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database,
                            nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being
                            transmitted to us over the Internet. And, of course, any information you include in a
                            posting to the discussion areas is available to anyone with Internet access.</p>
                        <p>However the internet is an ever evolving medium. We may change our Privacy Policy from time
                            to time to incorporate necessary future changes. Of course, our use of any information we
                            gather will always be consistent with the policy under which the information was collected,
                            regardless of what the new policy may be.</p>
